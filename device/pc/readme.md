PC simulation for testing and development
=========================================

The PC simulation allows you to try out new functions quickly and easily. Together with the Larus sil emulator, the flight 
player and XCSoar, realistic flight situations can be simulated and the displays optimized.

The software runs on Linux and Windows. The installation of the Rust programming language is described in detail [on the 
Rust homepage](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). In addition to the standard components, the SDL2 library is required. 
Installation instructions [can be found here](https://github.com/embedded-graphics/simulator).
