PC simulation for testing and development
=========================================

The PC simulation allows you to try out new functions quickly and easily. Together with the Larus sil emulator, the flight player and XCSoar, realistic flight situations can be simulated and the display optimized.

The software runs on Linux and Windows. 
- The installation of the Rust programming language is described in detail [on the Rust homepage](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). 
- In addition to the standard components, the SDL2 library is required. Installation instructions for this [can be found here](https://github.com/embedded-graphics/simulator).
- It is recommended to use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as a development environment. You will also need the plugins Cargo, CodeLLDB, Cortex-Debug, rust-analyzer.
