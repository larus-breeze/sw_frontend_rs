## **Deprecation warning**

`v0.7` of this crate is the last release. [mipidsi](https://github.com/almindor/mipidsi) is a new generic driver that contains ST7789 support and should serve as a drop in replacement for this driver.

## Features

These features are enabled by default:

* `graphics` - embedded-graphics support: pulls in [embedded-graphics](https://crates.io/crates/embedded-graphics) dependency
* `batch` - batch-drawing optimization: pulls in [heapless](https://crates.io/crates/heapless) dependency and allocates 300 bytes for frame buffer in the driver

## Status

- [x] Communications via SPI
- [x] Tested with PineTime watch
- [x] Hardware scrolling support
- [ ] Offscreen Buffering

## [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md)

## Minimum supported Rust version

The minimum supported Rust version for the st7789 driver is 1.51.0 or greater.
