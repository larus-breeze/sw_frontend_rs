/// The Core Crate is a software component that prepares all displays, processes all inputs and
/// measured values, and allows uniform access to all data. The component is not executable on
/// its own. It always requires an adaptation layer for the target hardware, which contains the
/// coupling to the hardware as well as to the real-time operating system. There are no
/// dependencies to the used hardware, so that a porting to a new system is simply possible. Only
/// some optical tweaks and the used images have to be adapted to the used display size.
///
/// Implementations for dedicated hardware environments can be found in the device directory.
///
/// The model-view-controller software pattern was used. The model contains all data relevant for
/// display and control. The controller processes measured values and inputs and indirectly
/// controls the display via the model. The display brings the information to the user (LCD and
/// speaker). An overview of the structure can be found in the doc directory.
